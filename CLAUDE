# General Rules and Guidelines
Best Practices for writing code: 

## Design Principles

Apply the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself
Prefer composition over inheritance for more maintainable code
Write pure functions when possible (no side effects, same output for same input)
Follow SOLID principles for maintainable object-oriented design
Write tests first (TDD) or alongside code development
Use dataclasses for data containers

## Handling Complexity

Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
Create abstractions that eliminate complexity for users
Encapsulate related data and behavior in cohesive classes
Use interfaces or abstract base classes to define contracts
Apply dependency injection for more flexible and testable code
Favor simple solutions over complex or clever ones
Design for the most common use case first
Keep component coupling loose through well-defined interfaces
